 * \brief Read unsigned analog temperature
 * \details
 *      Sample LM35 analog pin multiple times to find two identical samples to
 *      reduce noise. A maximum number of samples can be configured with macro
 *      LM35_MAX_SAMPLES. The last sampled temperature will be returned when
 *      no identical temperatures found.
 *
 *      Temperature range: 0.0 .. 110 degree Celsius:
 *      A negative temperature cannot be measured, because the ADC pin can only
 *      sample between positive 0.0 and 1.1 Volt.
 * \return
 *      Divide temperature by 10 to get the temperature integer, temperature
 *      modulo 10 results in the fraction, for example:
 *         int16_t temperature = 182 means 18.2 degree Celsius.
